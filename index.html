    <p>Hi, I'm Jennifer! I'm a student at the University of Michigan studying Data Science and Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I spend most of my time leading and volunteering for the Society of Women Engineers, where I plan social events, maintain our online presence, and organize a conference for women in leadership.</p>
    <p>I'm also interested in research involving education, and the potential for technology to advance education. In high school, I researched executive functions and their ability to predict learning outcomes.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I also love to <a href="books.html">read</a>, write, and practice taekwondo.</p>
