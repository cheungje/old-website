      <h2>Executive Functions Predicting Learning Outcomes in Science & English Language Tasks</h2>
      <p>Throughout high school, I was responsible for my younger brother who is diagnosed with ADHD and was advised to undergo medication. A desire to help my brother led me to reach out to Dr. Jan Plass of CREATE Lab to learn of a cognitive approach to ADHD. This began an independent three-year winning research project that earned Semifinalist in the 2018 Regeneron Science Talent Search, 1st Place in Behavioral Neuroscience at the NYC Science & Engineering Fair, <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/site/ataglance/2018/10/19177.html" target="_blank">press attention from NYU</a>, and an improved relationship with my brother and family.</p>
      <p>Executive functions (EF) refer to mental processes that help us to plan, complete, and prioritize tasks. Developing executive function helps us to lead better lives and is found to be more indicative of life success than intelligence quotient (IQ), predicting academic success, as well as success in marriage, career, and positive and mental health. These skills are essential to the positive development of a child and are the underlying processes to learning. However, the question that remains is, what specific executive functions are related to what types of learning tasks? In this study, we investigated how a science simulation exploration task uses EF skills and whether a learner's’ level of EF can predict their comprehension level. Results showed that specific EF skills can predict learning outcomes on science and English tasks. This study provides empirical evidence for the importance of developing EF skills in school and furthered our understanding of the kinds of tasks that tap into executive function skills. These findings have important implications for developing a minimal expense educational curriculum to nurture the academic and long-term success of students.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://joinlaunchpad.com/projects/public-health17" target="_blank">Ebola SOS - E</a></h2>
    <p>Problem: The Ebola Virus has known to persist within a survivor for years following recovery. Several survivors experience the “Post Ebola Syndrome” characterized by symptoms such as muscle deterioration, ocular problems, hypertension, diabetes, and mental health problems. It is unknown how long exactly the virus persists in the survivor. There is also a lack of medical staff in regions of the Ebola outbreak, making it difficult for survivors to receive adequate treatment.</p>
    <p>The product we designed is a contact lens and wristband system that would monitor the health of Ebola survivors in a discreet, non-invasive way, and communicate changes in survivors' bodies.
